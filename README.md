# Orbit - Trello inspired Kanban Board application - Frontend Project

Orbit is a task management app intended to showcase my ability to build structured, interactive frontends with React and TypeScript. 
I've implemented drag-and-drop functionality using React DnD, enabling smooth task reordering within columns.
To keep the project lightweight and focused on frontend fundamentals, I used localStorage for data persistence, ensuring a responsive and self-contained user experience while maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code.

### Inside each board is a kanban board where you can add/remove tasks and columns, and reorder with drag and drop.
