# Orbit - Kanban Board application - Frontend Project

Orbit is a task management app intended to showcase my ability to build structured, interactive frontends with React and TypeScript. 
I've implemented drag-and-drop functionality using React DnD, enabling smooth task reordering within columns.
To keep the project lightweight and focused on frontend fundamentals, I used localStorage for data persistence, ensuring a responsive and self-contained user experience while maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code.

## 📷 Screenshots - Everything is subject to change including this UI

### Main page showing a masonry grid with each board

### Inside each board is a Kanban board, where you can add/remove tasks and columns, and reorder with drag and drop.

### Alternatively, you can switch the layout to a masonry layout, which enables users to visually see more at once.

### After each operatation, a toast notification displays in the bottom right hand corner of the screen telling the user an operation has been carried out.
